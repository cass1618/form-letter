    <h1>Your Letter</h1>
    <p>Dear <span class="name"></span>, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
      I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
      I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
      There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
      Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
      But anyways, fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?
      My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
      If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
      I'ma name her Bonnie
      I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
      I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
      I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
      I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
      I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
      I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
      Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
      Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
      This is Stan</p>
